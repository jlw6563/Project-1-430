1. I am using the pokedex dataset
2. I have completed all my endpoints all that should be left if my code works properly is just client side stuff. All my GET endpoints have been test I haven't been able to test the HEAD or POST without my client stuff.
3. Client Side, I also need to finish it so I can throughly test HEAD requests and POST requests.
4. My plan which I have already started is making my own version of Static File Hosting. Any file added to the files folder will automatically have a filepath to it created it works so far for both my CSS and HTML client page. To make this I used the mime-types node package which allows me to figure out the mime-type of any file which I can pass to my function which handles the files.
5. In server.js on lines 12 - 14 I go some of the inspiration for the code through there but modified it heavily for my needs

Making note here my code is not passing CI for any reason other then my lines are too long. No actual errors
